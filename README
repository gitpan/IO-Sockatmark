NAME
    IO::Sockatmark - Perl extension for TCP urgent data

SYNOPSIS
      use IO::Sockatmark;
      use IO::Socket;

      my $sock = IO::Socket::INET->new('some_server');
      $sock->read(1024,$data) until $sock->atmark;

DESCRIPTION
    This module adds the atmark() method to the standard IO::Socket class.
    This can be used to detect the "mark" created by the receipt of TCP
    urgent data.

  Methods

    $flag = $socket->atmark()
        The atmark() method true if the socket is currently positioned at
        the urgent data mark, false otherwise.

  Exported functions

    $flag = atmark($socket)
        The atmark() function returns true if the socket is currently
        positioned at the urgent data mark, false otherwise. This will work
        with an IO::Socket object, as well as with a conventional filehandle
        socket.
